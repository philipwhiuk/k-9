## History

K-9 Mail was born when Jesse Vincent created a simple patch to the Email app included in Android 1.0. Back then the creators of the Android OS hadn't yet figured out how to handle community contributions. So he built his own version of the Email app and shared it with the world.

More recently K2 was forked from K-9 to provide a bleeding edge fast-paced release open source email client. As a successor to the popular K-9 'K2' was an obvious choice.
