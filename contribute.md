Help us make K2 Mail even better!


## Users

### Report a bug

* Use the [K2 issue tracker](https://github.com/philipwhiuk/k2/issues) to report bugs or request new features.

### Translate the app

K2 Mail uses [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/philipwhiuk/k2/) for translations. As features are added, there is often a need for translators to localise the text accordingly.


### Help other users

Help other users by responding to issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/philipwhiuk/k2/issues).

## Developers

### Get the source

The [source code](https://github.com/philipwhiuk/k2) is hosted on GitHub.

### Read the development documents

We maintain documentation on the design of the app in the [development section](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2/documentation/development.html) of the documentation. Feel free to contribute towards this and read it to guide patches to submit.

If you are new to Android then the [Android Developer site](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html) has lots of helpful resources.

### Finding issues to fix

A number of the issues are marked with the ['beginner'](https://github.com/philipwhiuk/k2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner) label indicating they are probably suitable for someone with not much experience of K2.

### Developing and submitting a patch

* The [Building K2](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2/documentation/development/building.html) page has information on how to build K2.
* We try to practice TDD as far as possible so do try and write tests surrounding your code (particularly in the back-end). Tests are also automatically run on pull requests so it's worth running the tests, especially ones related to code you have directly changed before submitting your code.
* See the [Code Style](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2/documentation/development/codestyle.html) for information on formatting your code so it matches our style.
* See the [Git Guide](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2/documentation/development/gitGuide.html) for information on using Git and submitting pull requests

## Designers

The design of K2 is constantly evolving. Feel free to suggest improvements to the design as an issue/comment on the GitHub project.

## Documentation

Like everything else, this manual is the work of volunteers. If you feel it could be improved with information on a certain topic, feel free to contribute by [creating an issue on the tracker](https://github.com/philipwhiuk/k2/issues) or submitting a pull request to the `gh-pages` branch.
