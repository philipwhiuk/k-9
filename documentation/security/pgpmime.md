# PGP/MIME Encryption

In K2 we aim to support OpenPGP, a specification of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), an encryption method developed
in the early 90s that uses a 'web of trust' to validate certificates.

In previous releases of K2 Mail we have supported basic integration with 
[Android Privacy Guard (APG)](http://www.thialfihar.org/projects/apg/).

However with development on the project stalled and with a desire to better support PGP/MIME in the app,
newer releases (5.200 and later) move to support [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) via a public API
which we hope other apps which want to provide PGP key storage can support.
