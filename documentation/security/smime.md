# S/MIME

S/MIME or Secure MIME, is a alternative method of securing e-mail.
Instead of a web of trust model of verifying the identity of a recipient,
S/MIME relies on the Trusted Certificate Authority model, similar to the security model for SSL.

K2 Mail does not currently support S/MIME, however forks of the upstream project
such as <a href="https://github.com/FAU-Inf2/SMile">SMile</a> have attempted to implemented it, so there is
a desire to see work to see S/MIME incorporated into the code base.
