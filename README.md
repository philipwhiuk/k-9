# K2 Website

This branch provides the source for [K2's website](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2) which provides public-facing documentation for K2.

It is a combination of Markdown, HTML, CSS which is rendered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Writing content

Pages are written mainly using Markdown along with included headers that set-up much of the formatting and pages.
There are headers that provide the necessary navigation sections (for example the documentation page listing).
These are not automatically generated so must be updated if a new page is added.

To submit new content, provide a pull-request.

## Writing a blog

These are mainly written using HTML. There is not yet much templating surrounding this area - to get the basic structure copy an existing blog post.

## Suggesting content

Ideas for new website content currently mainly comes from individual thoughts and comments on K2's issue tracker.
If you feel there's content missing then feel free to favourite an existing issue or if it's not been covered by an issue,
open a new one.
