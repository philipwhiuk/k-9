# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation section of the K2 Mail website.

This section aims to provide information on current features (and give some pointers on future direction where possible). However as a living project, the section is a constant work-in-progress and is often developed along-side / after the features themselves.

Changes are documented in the [release notes](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2/releaseNotes.xml) distributed with the app.

Upcoming changes are listed in the beta's [release notes](https://philipwhiuk.github.io/k2/beta_releaseNotes.xml) distributed along with the beta.

If you have any comments please feel free to <a href="contribute.html">provide feedback</a>
